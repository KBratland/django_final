Project:  Fruit Finder

TODO:
geodjango tutorial in order to put in a mapping app for finding fruit. goal is to be able to create a Tree entity with location data. This will relate to the tree attribute db/model but for the project I just want to get the tree on a map!
Look into appropriate data sources for spatial data - perhaps just portland or oregon
determine method for setting location to a lat long
determine table structure for lat long
determine method for returning lat long as a dot on a map

11/16/14
changed sqlite3 db to postgres (that took some hacking)
updated project to be GeoDjango compatible - settings, admin reg, db extensions, etc.
created fruitlocate app


DONE:
register
login
profile that updates
11/12 the geodjango tutorial is pretty far from what I want to do as far as learning the steps to make a map work!
