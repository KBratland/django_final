Look into appropriate data sources for spatial data - perhaps just portland or oregon
determine method for setting location to a lat long
determine table structure for lat long
determine method for returning lat long as a dot on a map
determine how to make the type of fruit tree a drop down menu. Have date in file called fruit variety
